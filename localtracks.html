          LocalTracks <br> Master Thesis Project
        </h1>
        <p class="body-m">
          In recent years, the topic of sustainability has gained a wide attention, with a notable increase in online searches for related themes. However, small local farms in Italy face significant challenges: in the last decade, 30% of active farms have disappeared.
          <span> </span>
          The goal of LocalTracks, my Master Thesis project, was to promote local agricultural producers creating a connection with customers.

        <div>
          <p class="body-s">
            Designing a platform for producers unfamiliar with digital tools was one of the biggest challenges of this project. However, their willingness to collaborate provided valuable insights that shaped the app. Iterative testing allowed me to refine the design and create a user-friendly solution tailored to their needs.

          User research
        </h2>
        <div>
        <p class="body-s">
          Research combined qualitative and quantitative methods, including interviews with 15 customers and 9 local producers. Key Insights:
          <br><span></span>
          <b>Customer Challenges</b><br>
          Short-term trips are often spontaneous, planned at the last minute with a focus on relaxation. Customers prefer trusted recommendations and are drawn to unique, authentic experiences in natural settings.
          <br><span></span>
          <b>Producer Challenges</b><br>
          Local producers often struggle to promote their businesses online due to limited digital skills. Many are open to collaboration with neighboring producers to offer complementary services.
          <br><span></span>
          These insights revealed a clear opportunity: the natural beauty surrounding many producers can serve as a bridge, combining sustainable products with immersive travel experiences.

            After defining the user flow, information architecture, and wireframes, the concept of LocalTracks came to life with the following features:
            <br><span></span>
            <b>Nature-Driven Inspiration</b><br>
            LocalTracks links local producers with walking, cycling, and hiking paths nearby, leveraging natural surroundings to attract customers.
            <br><span></span>
            <b>Unexplored Paths</b><br>
            Producers can create and share custom trails that are featured on the app. These “unexplored paths” encourage users to review and explore unique experiences.
            <br><span></span>
            <b>Photo Reward Program</b><br>
            A “photo rewards” feature allows producers to engage customers by asking them to take photos of their businesses. In exchange, customers receive incentives such as tastings, creating a win-win interaction.

      Testing and results
    </h2>
    <div>
      <p class="body-s">
        The prototype was tested with 6 producers and 12 customers, achieving strong usability scores (SUS: 83.9 for customers, 86.6 for producers). Feedback led to key improvements, including:
        <ul class="body-s">
          <li>
            Prioritizing a mobile-first design for producers.
          </li>
          <li>
          Adding an activities section to allow producers to promote events like tastings or guided hikes.
        </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br><span></span>
      <p class="body-s">
        This project culminated in my graduation with a score of 110/110 and demonstrated the potential of design as a tool for fostering connections between people, nature, and local communities.
