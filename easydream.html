          In 2021, easyJet presented a challenge during the Reply Creative Challenge: “How can we improve the customer experience in choosing their next destination with easyJet?”
          Travelers often found themselves overwhelmed by too many options and uninspiring tools, making destination selection a stressful experience.
          <span />
          This is the story of how a team of four design students designed easyDream, the project that won first place among 170 global submissions.

            <li>
              <b>Stressful Decision-Making: </b>
              Users were frustrated by the overwhelming number of “Top 10 destinations” lists, which provided little actionable value.

            <li>
              <b>Group Dynamics: </b>

            <b>User Journey</b><br>
            An analysis of the current user journey revealed a major pain point: travelers often abandon research due to disengaging and cluttered travel websites. easyDream addresses this by offering a seamless, inspiring journey that allows users to find their ideal match in just a few clicks.
            <br><span></span>
            <b>App Architecture</b><br>
            The app’s architecture was designed to enable users to achieve their goals with minimal effort. Each interaction was optimized for clarity and simplicity, ensuring a fluid experience across different touchpoints.
            <br><span></span>
            <b>Prototyping</b><br>
            High-fidelity prototypes were developed using Figma and Protopie, emphasizing usability and functionality. The prototypes demonstrated how users could explore, collaborate, and book trips effortlessly.
