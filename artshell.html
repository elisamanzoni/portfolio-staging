          Artshell’s Export <br> feature redesign
        </h1>
        <p class="body-m">
          Artshell provides a digital archive platform for art galleries, artists, and collectors. Among its many features, the Export function allows users to share documents from their archive.<br>
          <span />
          Frequent feedback from Customer Care highlighted that users found this feature overly complex and lacking customization options. In 2024, Artshell prioritized a redesign to improve usability and introduce greater flexibility.

          As the only UX designer at Artshell, I led the Export feature redesign, working closely with the product manager, UI designers, and development team. I also collaborated on creating a new design system, which debuted in this feature to support the company’s evolving brand identity.

          Personal thoughts
        </h2>
        <p class="body-s">
          This project holds a special place for me, as it was my first big improvement for Artshell. Being the only UX designer, I had the challenge—and the opportunity—of bringing new ideas into the company, especially with the design system that will now guide future features. A challenge I faced was that we didn’t have a large user base to test with, so we had to rely on a small internal group. It made the launch feel a bit risky, but the results have been really positive!

          <b>Identifying User Needs</b>  <br />
          To understand the needs and frustrations of users, I interviewed the Customer Care team and conducted benchmarking research on eight competitors. Key insights included:
          <ul class="body-s">
            <li>
              <b>Simplified Exporting: </b>
              Users often struggled with the export flow and frequently relied on Customer Care for guidance. A straightforward, one-click export was essential to reduce friction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Visual Appeal for Digital Sharing: </b>
              With art institutions sharing materials on platforms like WhatsApp, users desired exports that could be shared in an aesthetically pleasing way.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Customization Options: </b>
              Users wanted greater flexibility in presenting their exports, a feature that many of our competitors already offered.

          Analysis and Wireframe
        </h2>
        <div>
          <p class="body-s">
            Given the complexity of the existing export process, I conducted a detailed analysis of the current workflow to identify key issues. Navigation was a significant pain point, with users unsure of what data could be exported and how. I reorganized the element hierarchy, enlarged the sidebar, and added a navigation bar to make the export options clearer and easier to access.
            <br><span />
          <b>Enhanced Customization</b><br>
          After establishing the architecture, I designed new features that provided greater customization options. Users could now tailor exports to align with their personal or organizational brand, addressing a major user need.

        </h2>
        <div>
          <p class="body-s">
            As the Export feature became more complex, our goal remained to make it simple and user-friendly. With Artshell undergoing a rebranding, I collaborated with the UI designer and development team to create a new design system that would support the app’s evolving needs. This new system, first introduced in the Export feature, aligned with the new brand style and included dynamic components, making it adaptable for future updates across the platform.

      Test and Results
    </h2>
    <div>
      <p class="body-s">
        <b>Validating the Prototype</b><br>
        I developed a high-fidelity prototype of the redesigned Export feature, which we tested with the Customer Care team. To determine the best navigation, we conducted A/B testing on two styles: a wizard format versus a lateral menu. The lateral menu performed better, with users finding it more straightforward and intuitive.
        <br><span></span>
      <b>Launch and Early Results</b><br>
      The redesigned Export feature launched with excellent feedback, resulting in a 30% increase in usage. Our new design system, coupled with close collaboration with the development team, ensured a cohesive and efficient rollout.
