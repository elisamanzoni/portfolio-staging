          Amazon <br> Learning Tool redesign
        </h1>
        <p class="body-m">
          In 2022, Amazon undertook a full redesign of its internal Learning Management System (LMS) to simplify training across the organization. Previously, Amazon relied on 9 different third-party LMS platforms, which presented considerable usability challenges due to their complexity.
          <span />
          This redesign aimed to create a unified system to streamline training processes and improve the user experience.

        <p class="body-s">
          As a UX Design Intern, I supported the lead designer by taking charge of the research, design, and testing phases of the Amazon Learning Tool redesign. Working alongside the lead designer, I also collaborated closely with a UX researcher and development team to ensure the redesign addressed user needs effectively.

        <p class="body-s">
          This project was my first experience working for a large organization, and it was inspiring to collaborate with such a diverse team. A key challenge was defining user needs early in the process, as they were initially unclear. Through close collaboration with the UX researcher, we successfully identified key pain points and addressed them in the redesign.
          <span />
          Presenting the final prototype to Amazon’s leadership team was a career highlight—directors quickly grasped the flow and design intent, which reinforced the value of our work.

          <b>Defining Customers</b>  <br />
          The primary users of the Learning Tool are learning administrators responsible for assigning training to employees and ensuring assignments are accurate.
          <br><span />
          <b>Identifying User Needs</b>  <br />
          Usability testing of the existing platform with 10 administrators revealed key pain points:

            <li>
              <b>Frequent Errors: </b>
              Complex workflows led to incorrect training assignments.

            <li>
              <b>Repetitive Processes: </b>
              Administrators often had to repeat steps to assign training to large groups, wasting time.

            <li>
              <b>Poor Experience: </b>
              13% of users found the platform frustrating due to unclear workflows and insufficient guidance.

            An analysis of the current workflow, conducted in collaboration with the Tech Product Manager, highlighted significant usability issues. The learner selection step emerged as a major pain point, with unclear terminology and a lack of guidance complicating the process.
            <br><span></span>
          Research into similar tools from Google and Facebook informed the creation of a streamlined, multi-step workflow for selecting learners. This approach simplified navigation and reduced errors, making the process more intuitive.

          <b>Accessibility</b>  <br />
          An accessibility document was developed to ensure the redesign adhered to Amazon’s inclusivity standards, making the tool usable for a diverse audience.

        <b>Validating the Prototype</b><br>
        Usability testing, conducted with nine learning administrators, led to a 7.5-point improvement in the System Usability Score (SUS). Feedback from these sessions emphasized the importance of providing guidance for new users, which informed the implementation of hint cards and contextual help.
        <br><span></span>
      <b>Launch and Early Results</b><br>
      The redesigned Amazon Learning Tool launched in January 2023 to positive feedback, with significant improvements in usability and user satisfaction. The streamlined interface and error prevention features contributed to more efficient training management across Amazon.
